Certainly! Here are the formulas again using LaTeX:

The loss function is:

$$Loss(\theta) = E\left[\left(r + \gamma * \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta') - Q(s, a; \theta)\right)^2\right]$$

where $\theta$ are the weights of the neural network, $r$ is the reward obtained at the current time step, $\gamma$ is the discount factor (a value between 0 and 1 that determines the importance of future rewards), $s'$ is the next state, $a'$ is the action taken in the next state, and $\theta'$ are the weights of the target network.

The action-value function, $Q(s,a)$, estimates the expected long-term reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$.

The target network is a separate neural network that is used to stabilize the training of the main network.

To train the DQN, the agent follows the following steps at each time step:

1.  Observe the current state of the environment, $s$.
2.  Choose an action, $a$, based on the current state and the current policy (e.g. using an epsilon-greedy policy).
3.  Take the action and observe the reward, $r$, and the next state, $s'$.
4.  Store the transition $(s, a, r, s')$ in a replay buffer.
5.  Sample a batch of transitions from the replay buffer and use it to update the weights of the main network using gradient descent and the loss function.
6.  Update the target network by copying the weights of the main network every few steps.

The replay buffer is used to store past transitions and sample from them to break the temporal correlation between the transitions. This helps to stabilize the learning process and prevent the network from overfitting to the most recent transitions.
