Today I want to explore a subject I have spent the past couple of years learning: Reinforcement Learning. And particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

Reinforcement Learning is a setting where an agent takes an action in an environment and receives a reward signal that is either positive or negative. This is the central loop of most reinforcement learning problems.

Our goal is to use the reward feedback to improve our ability to maximize culmulative reward, called return, and sufficiently explore the environment. 

There are a few different terms to be aware of within the field of RL. Some of the most important include values, policies, trajectories, return, and reward.

*Trajectories*
*Policies*
*Values*
*Bellman Equations*
