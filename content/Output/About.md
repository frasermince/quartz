Welcome to my blog and digital garden. Here you will find a list of notes and articles in different stages of development. This mostly exists for my own learning and as a way to learn in the open. I am adopting the [digital garden approach](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). As such each article will have different tags to display how far along they are.

* Seedlings - articles just getting started. Things might be rough or unfinished. Reading it you will be in the early stages of my process as a I seek to learn in the open
* Budding - more finished articles but maybe still needing some polish.
* Evergreen - completely finished articles, unlikely to change much in the future except for possibly some small corrections here or there.

I plan to write mostly about Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and anything else I am learning about in the field of Machine Learning.
