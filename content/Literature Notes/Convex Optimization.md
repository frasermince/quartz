An affine set is a set where all variables that have coefficients that add up to 1.
This means that any combination of points will be a subset of the set.

The affine hull can be taken on any arbitrary set. If it is not an affine set then the affine hull will be all of the planes itself. If it is already an affine set then the affine dimension will be less than of the set itself.
