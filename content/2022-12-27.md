Sure! Here are the formulas for the surrogate advantage and the constraint in the TRPO algorithm using LaTeX:

Objective (surrogate advantage):

$${\mathcal L}(\theta_k, \theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s,a \sim \pi_{\theta_k}} \left[ \frac{\pi_{\theta}(a|s)}{\pi_{\theta_k}(a|s)} A^{\pi_{\theta_k}}(s,a) \right]$$

Constraint:

$$\bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \pi_{\theta_k}} \left[ D_{KL}\left(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|s) || \pi_{\theta_k} (\cdot|s) \right) \right] \leq \delta$$

where $\pi_{\theta}(a|s)$ is the new policy with parameters $\theta$, $A^{\pi_{\theta_k}}(s,a)$ is the advantage function for the old policy, and $\bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k)$ is an average KL-divergence between policies across states visited by the old policy. The constraint requires that the KL-divergence between the new and old policies be less than or equal to a predetermined threshold $\delta$.


In order to solve the optimization problem in TRPO using the methods of Lagrangian duality, we would first define the Lagrangian function as:

$$L(\theta, \lambda, \nu) = {\mathcal L}(\theta_k, \theta) + \lambda \left(\bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) - \delta\right) + \nu \left(\bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) + \delta\right)$$

where $\lambda$ and $\nu$ are Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints on the KL-divergence between the new and old policies.

Next, we would minimize the Lagrangian function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers while holding the optimization variable $\theta$ fixed, resulting in the dual problem:

$$\min_{\lambda \geq 0, \nu \geq 0} g(\lambda, \nu) = \min_{\lambda \geq 0, \nu \geq 0} \left[ -\lambda \delta + \nu \delta + \max_{\theta} {\mathcal L}(\theta_k, \theta) + \lambda \bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) + \nu \bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) \right]$$

The solution to this dual problem can provide a bound for the original optimization problem, or the same optimal solution as the original problem, depending on whether the original problem is convex and satisfies a constraint qualification.

Once the dual problem has been solved, the optimal solution to the
$$\max_{\theta} {\mathcal L}(\theta_k, \theta) - \lambda \bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k) - \nu \bar{D}_{KL}(\theta || \theta_k)$$
